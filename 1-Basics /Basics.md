# Create and mount Vue app

# Data object to dynamically populate HTML content

# Event listener
- **v-on:**
- **@**

# Conditional rendering 
- **v-if** Removes totally from the DOM
- **v-else**
- **v-show** changes to display: none

This means that v-show consumes less resources 

# Toggle content and labels

# Mouse events

We automatically get the event object as the first argument, however if we want to use further arguments, we have to explicitly state the the event arguments using the $ sign: $event.
