This project will use json server for the practice of using fetch with each crud operation.

The project build process is the focus here as well as modelling patterns.

# Set up the project 

- Create the vue project
- Create GitHub repo
- Fire up vue server
- Install and fire up json-server (in a new terminal)
- Remove any boiler plate files and code not used

# Set up the home page 

Set up home page and json file so each data object is being fetched and the title being displayed on the home page as a starting point.

# Externalise the template used to display tasks on the home page

This is to be a reusable component, located within the components folder to be added to the home view component
