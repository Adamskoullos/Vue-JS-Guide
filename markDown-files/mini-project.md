# Lifecycle Hooks
Lifecycle hooks are built in Vue functions that fire at different stages of a components lifecycle.  These functions are used as hooks to run code.  
For example we can capture the point at which a component mounts an element, when there is an update to a property or when a component is unmounted, when a user navigates away from a page/view that uses a component and the components lifecycle finishes. 

Below is an image from the Vue docs, displaying each event hook:
